This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

üëã Welcome to Jiyeon Yang's Website! 
======
<br>
I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at Yale University, üéì
where I aim to explore how the brain encodes the external world and how neural circuits‚Äîthrough their diverse neuronal types and connectivity‚Äîgive rise to specific functions and behaviors.
<br>
My academic foundation began with a B.S. in [Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.hanyang.ac.kr/) at Hanyang University, where I also minored in BIO-Software Convergence. I graduated with Summa Cum Laude honors and was recognized on the Dean‚Äôs List. I later earned an M.S. in [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://bcs.snu.ac.kr/) from Seoul National University, where I further developed my interdisciplinary expertise in both experimental and computational neuroscience.

#### üß† Undergraduate research - 1: Macro-scale Human Brain Networks
Motivated by a desire to bridge different scales of neural organization from microcircuits to large-scale networks, I have pursued research across a wide range of systems. During my undergraduate years, I worked in the [Computational NeuroImage Analysis Lab](http://cna.hanyang.ac.kr/), where I analyzed large-scale human fMRI data from the ABIDE database. My project focused on identifying differences in functional connectivity between individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) alone and those with comorbid ADHD. I employed Graph Neural Network (GNN) models to classify the two groups and extract key network-level features.

#### üß© Undergraduate research - 2: Transition to Circuit-level Computation
While this research helped me appreciate macro-scale brain function, I became increasingly curious about what lies within a single voxel‚Äîhow neurons within that small volume compute and connect. Although initially overwhelmed by the brain‚Äôs complexity, I found clarity and inspiration while studying John von Neumann‚Äôs computational architecture, where simple components like transistors and diodes give rise to powerful logic systems. This realization deepened my interest in circuit-level computation and led me to join the [Kim Lab](https://www.jkimlab.com/) at the Korean Institute of Science and Technology. There, I contributed to behavioral analyses of mouse models, proposed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for classifying behavior in SHANK3 knockout mice (an autism model), and helped construct a Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) to analyze decision-making during locomotion.

#### üê≠üñ•Ô∏è Masters research : Experimental and Computational Approach
At the [Neural Computation Lab](https://www.snu-ncl.com/) at Seoul National University, I led two major research projects. One focused on simulating spiking neural networks to understand how specific connectivity motifs among neurons shape computational output. The other involved in vivo calcium imaging in freely moving mice, where I examined how different neuronal subtypes encode spatial information in real time. These projects allowed me to integrate my computational skills with hands-on experimental techniques and pursue neuroscience across scales.

<br>
Ultimately, I am committed to becoming a neuroscientist who hopes to contribute to the open sciences ü§ù, making neuroscience more accessible and collaborative to accelerate our understanding of the brain, ourselves, and the world we live in.
